docker-chef-solo
================

Basic Docker Image with Chef-Solo installed

warning under development there be dragons here

## Example usage

Make a docker file that looks something like this:
https://github.com/joshuacox/ddd/blob/master/Dockerfile

The important parts you need to customize are the chef specific files especially roles, in the example above you can see how I applied the roles that were used from the VDD project 
https://www.drupal.org/project/vdd

Iâ€™ll copy the commented lines from the Dockerfile here as an example of what you need to uncomment and put in your dockerfile to make use of this base container
```
#RUN echo "Installing berksfile..."
#ADD ./Berksfile /Berksfile
#ADD ./chef/roles /var/chef/roles
#ADD ./chef/solo.rb /var/chef/solo.rb
#ADD ./chef/solo.json /var/chef/solo.json

#RUN echo "Installing berks This may take a few minutes..."
#RUN cd / && /opt/chef/embedded/bin/berks vendor /var/chef/cookbooks
#RUN chef-solo -c /var/chef/solo.rb -j /var/chef/solo.json

#RUN easy_install supervisor
#RUN echo "foo...."
#ADD ./start.sh /start.sh
#ADD ./foreground.sh /etc/apache2/foreground.sh
#ADD ./supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf

#RUN chmod 755 /start.sh /etc/apache2/foreground.sh
#EXPOSE 80
#CMD ["/bin/bash", "/start.sh"]
```
